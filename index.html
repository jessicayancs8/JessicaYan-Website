        <p class="lead mb-4">An 18 year-old college student with a history of volunteer work and intern experience. Seeking part-time work experience and professional opportunities for skill development.
        <br><br>
        In the past, I have volunteered and worked at my local tennis academy as well as at Coast Personnel Services. My job as a volunteer was to instruct children varying from ages  4 to 12 in proper stroke and match play skills. While dealing with these kids, I taught different exercises such as ground strokes and volleys as well as ball tosses and figure-eights that promote hand-eye coordination. Through my extensive time as a volunteer at Conidi Grech Tennis,  I have learned to effectively communicate with younger children as well as parents regarding any questions and concerns.The company Coast Personnel Services is a staffing agency that provides job opportunities for incoming clients. During my summer of junior year, I was allowed the opportunity to attend a paid internship at a Coast Personnel Services. This experience has led me to develop and strengthen new interpersonal, communication, and leadership skills while also having a glimpse of a proper working environment. 
        <br><br>
        During my high school years, I was involved in numerous clubs and activities that allowed me to gain skills that are useful in the workforce today. As secretary of the Language-Connection Club at my high school, I strive to promote a welcoming environment for incoming and current English Language Development students. I am responsible for creating PowerPoint slides to inform club members about upcoming activities and events. Working closely with the club president, I organize weekly tutoring sessions that help these students that are struggling in subjects like math, English, and science. Link Crew is a team at American High School that focuses on helping incoming freshmen transition from junior high into high school. I knew that high school can be a new and inticing environment for students so I chose to sign up for this opportunity.The change from junior high to high school can be frightening, but I believe that Link Crew is something that definitely eases this new adjustment and slows down all of the stress to conform to this vast community of students. I also hope on expanding my leadership skills and challenging myself to new heights with this new and exceptional experience. I believe that being a Link Leader can help other students succeed in school by encouraging those who are overwhelmed by this new environment. These freshmen need positive role-models that are able to connect with them, and follow up with them both socially and academically, to ensure that they are doing well in this new environment. I want to motivate, inspire, and make the freshmen feel welcome and comfortable at American High School. A good Link Leader is someone that is positive, respectful, open-minded, and a good role model for others to look up to. As a member of Link Crew, these leaders are responsible for keeping them on track through freshman year. Being a part of my school's Link Crew team, I was responsible for creating games and activities that implement teamwork and managing responsibilities.
